## My opinnion and thoughts

The most complex project I've ever made. In result I have a small application, that can do useful things if it's needed; gain new experience and skills, improve old ones. It's was challenging, but more important, it was fun (but not buttons, buttons are creapy).
In conclusion I can only say:
